# $ga77su is an experiment in self-sovereignty.

## observation

**problems with traditional finance:**  
traditional finance is centralized, leading to inequality and inefficiency, with individuals having limited control over their money.  

**the rise of decentralization:**  
bitcoin introduced decentralized currency, empowering individuals by removing centralized control. however, it creates a hive-mind mentality, where its value depends on collective belief, limiting individuality.

**smart contracts & speculative tokens:**  
the advent of smart contracts enabled defi and token creation, but this led to an influx of speculative tokens, driven by hype and pump-and-dump cycles, destabilizing the market and offering little long-term value.

**self-created currency as an alternative:**  
a self-created cryptocurrency, grown over time, offers a more individual-centered approach, providing true financial sovereignty and moving beyond speculative behaviors.

## question

**core question:**  
can creating and using a self-created cryptocurrency offer individuals greater financial autonomy and self-sovereignty, as an alternative to traditional finance and speculative cryptocurrencies?
