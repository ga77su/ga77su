## observation

**Problems with Traditional Finance:**   
Centralized systems create control imbalances, economic inequality, and dependence on financial institutions, often leading to inefficiency and corruption.  

**Rise of Cypherpunks & Bitcoin:**
Bitcoin offered a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies, empowering individuals with control over their own money and challenging the dominance of central banks.
    
**Ethereum & Smart Contracts:**  
Ethereum introduced smart contracts, enabling decentralized applications and tokens. Platforms like Solana offered faster, cheaper alternatives for building decentralized financial systems.  
  
**Proliferation of Shitcoins:**
The crypto space became flooded with tokens that lacked real value or utility, often used for speculative trading and Ponzi schemes rather than building lasting financial systems.
  
**Missing Piece:**   
Despite the growth of decentralized finance, the idea of truly owning and controlling oneâ€™s personal currency remains underexplored.
