# experimental design: self-sovereign currency

## observation

**problems with traditional finance:**  
traditional finance is centralized, leading to inequality and inefficiency, with individuals having limited control over their money.  

**the rise of decentralization:**  
bitcoin introduced decentralized currency, empowering individuals by removing centralized control. however, it creates a hive-mind mentality, where its value depends on collective belief, limiting individuality.

**smart contracts & speculative tokens:**  
the advent of smart contracts enabled defi and token creation, but this led to an influx of speculative tokens, driven by hype and pump-and-dump cycles, destabilizing the market and offering little long-term value.

**self-created currency as an alternative:**  
a self-created cryptocurrency, grown over time, offers a more individual-centered approach, providing true financial sovereignty and moving beyond speculative behaviors.

## question

**core question:**  
can creating and using a self-created cryptocurrency allow individuals to achieve greater financial autonomy and self-sovereignty, as an alternative to the limitations of traditional finance, bitcoin, and speculative tokens?

## hypothesis

**hypothesis:**  
if individuals create and use their own cryptocurrency, it will offer them greater financial autonomy and self-sovereignty. over time, this approach will reduce reliance on centralized financial systems, diminish the impact of speculative token markets, and foster more individual control over personal wealth, creating a more sustainable financial model.

## experiment

**setup:**  
launch a personal cryptocurrency using pump.fun on solana to ensure easy creation, liquidity access, and market exposure without needing to manage complex liquidity pools directly.
  
**public tracking:**  
create public channels (twitter and telegram) to post regular updates, track the currencyâ€™s development, and document personal experiences, thoughts, and strategies. transparency will allow others to observe and learn from the process without being pressured to participate.  

**personal use only:**  
use the currency as a personal savings vehicle, focusing on growing its value over years through consistent commitment, rather than seeking short-term speculation or external investment.  

**no promotion or solicitation:**  
do not encourage others to buy or invest in the currency. the experiment is about self-growth and building a legacy, not about creating external demand or hype.  

**long-term observation:**  
treat the project as a decades-long experiment, observing how the currency evolves alongside personal growth, and whether it fosters real sovereignty compared to reliance on traditional finance, bitcoin, or speculative tokens.  

**encourage independent experiments:**  
while not promoting the specific coin, encourage others to start their own experiments, planting and nurturing their own financial seeds instead of chasing external alpha.
