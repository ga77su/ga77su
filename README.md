# $ga77su is an **experiment** in self-sovereignty.

## observation

**problems with traditional finance:**   
centralized systems create control imbalances, economic inequality, and dependence on financial institutions, often leading to inefficiency and corruption.  

**rise of cypherpunks & bitcoin:**  
bitcoin offered a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies, empowering individuals with control over their own money and challenging the dominance of central banks.
    
**ethereum & smart contracts:**  
ethereum introduced smart contracts, enabling decentralized applications and tokens. platforms like solana offered faster, cheaper alternatives for building decentralized financial systems.  
  
**proliferation of shitcoins:**  
the crypto space became flooded with tokens that lacked real value or utility, often used for speculative trading and ponzi schemes rather than building lasting financial systems.
  
**missing piece:**   
despite the growth of decentralized finance, the idea of *truly owning and controlling oneâ€™s personal currency* remains underexplored.  

## question

**core question:**  
can creating and using a personal cryptocurrency, like $ga77su, allow individuals to achieve greater control over their savings and financial identity, compared to traditional finance systems or existing cryptocurrencies?
