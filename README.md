# $ga77su is an experiment in self-sovereignty.

## observation

**problems with traditional finance:**  
traditional finance is centralized, creating inequality and inefficiency, with individuals having limited control over their money.  

**the rise of bitcoin & decentralization:**  
bitcoin and ethereum offered decentralized alternatives to traditional finance, empowering individuals and sparking the growth of decentralized finance (defi).  

**the issue with speculative tokens:**  
the crypto space has become flooded with shitcoins, which are built for short-term profit through speculation, leading to pump-and-dump cycles and volatile markets.  

**self-created currency as an alternative:**  
a personal cryptocurrency, grown over time, offers a more stable and sovereign alternative. it’s focused on long-term growth and individual control, creating a financial system that’s less reliant on speculation.  

## question

**core question:**  
can creating and using a personal cryptocurrency, like $ga77su, allow individuals to achieve greater control over their savings and financial identity, compared to traditional finance systems or existing cryptocurrencies?
